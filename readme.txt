### RUNNING THE PROGRAM
This is a normal three js install and I use npx vite to run it.

1. Install Node.js

2. In current this directory run
npm install --save three

3. In current this directory run
npm install --save-dev vite

4. In current this directory run
npx vite

Then you should be able to open the three js scene, all models and textures
are in the respective folders.

### EXTERNAL RESOURCES
Most of the models I have made myself with free textures.
The statues bases are from SketchUp's 3D warehouse.
The human model is from SketchFab.
The trees and ground textures were licensed under commercial use.
